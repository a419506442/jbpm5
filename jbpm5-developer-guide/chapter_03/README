Chapter 3 - Using BPMN 2.0 to Model Business Scenarios

This chapter contains a single project containing the process definitions present
in Chapter 3. 
Since the process execution is not yet discussed in the book, there is no test
in the project that executes any of the processes. In Chapter 5 most of these
processes are going to be executed and tested.
The idea of this chapter is to import into jBPM Web Designer the processes 
contained in this project so you can start getting familiar with both, the
process representation and the tooling. These 2 topics are covered in detail
in Chapter 5.

The processes included in this chapter are:

1) HospitalEmergencyScenarioV1-data.bpmn: Simple process showing how data is
defined in a process and how it flows through the different tasks.
2) HospitalEmergencyScenarioV1.bpmn: First executable version of Simple Emergency
Bed Request process. This process is a more complete version of the process
mentioned in the book since it is ready to be executed.
3) HospitalEmergencyScenarioV2.bpmn: An extension of V1 containing a diverging
gateway creating different execution paths.
4) HospitalEmergencyScenarioV3.bpmn: Another extension over V2, this time introducing
an Intermediate Catch Event to have loosely coupled execution paths in a single
process definition.
5) residentsHiringV1.bpmn: A process definition covering some advance topics like
timers and multiple-instance tasks.
